    <center><p>Every morning, I would wake up to the rhythmic monotonous clacking of a keyboard and its complimentary squeak of my fatherâ€™s chair, signifying the start of the day for my family. I could always expect him to be awake before the rest of us and long hours after us. The appeal of this routine was a peculiar one for my 5 year old brain and always left me with a question unanswered: How could one spend hours each day staring at a screen, just typing? Flash forward to when I turned 10 and I decided to finally enroll in an online HTML course, and I never looked back. I too, was entranced by a world of algorithms and binaries, absorbed by the sublimity of rhythmic, monotonous clacking of a keyboard. Since that first tutorial, I knew the answer to the question that had always stumped me, and pursued that feeling through this moment.
